This script will take a bedGraph file of A site RPF density as input, 
use A site density on putative start codons, enrichment of in-frame periodicity, and overall RPF density to assign to putative start codons a likelihood score of being used as an initiation codon, and 
- Plot density in each of three frames on plus strand across the mito genome, label known starts and ends, and label scores of putative start codons
- Plot distribution of all scores

Note paths have not been generalized and will have to be modified throughout
